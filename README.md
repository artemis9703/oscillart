# oscillart

i decided to theme my website after ocean colors because im currently sailing across the pacific. i made this with html, css and javascript. i got the idea on my night watch around 2am and decided to try to turn it into an oscillart submission. :)

i spent almost 5 and a half hours on this project, and its one of the first javascript projects ive ever made. i had quite a lot of bugs, and im very happy i was able to fix them all.
